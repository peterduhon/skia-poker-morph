# :video_game: Skia Poker Project Status Update

Dear **Team**,

I hope this update finds you well. As we approach the final stages of our project, I wanted to provide a comprehensive overview of our progress, upcoming milestones, and the steps we need to take to ensure a successful delivery.

## :green_circle: Current Status

1. **Smart Contracts and Game Logic** (:green_circle:):
   - Thanks to the dedicated efforts of our team, the **smart contract development**, **Chainlink integration**, and overall **game logic implementation** are on track and progressing smoothly.

2. **UI/UX and Web3Auth Integration** (:orange_circle:):
   - The **UI/UX** and **Web3Auth** components are currently in progress, with work assigned to the respective team members.
   - However, there is some ambiguity in the timeline due to school exams for the individuals responsible for these tasks.
   - We have scheduled a meeting on **September 1st** at **12:30 ET** to review the status and clarify any uncertainties.

## :date: Upcoming Milestones Part 1

1. **Code Cleanup and Shared Library Integration** (**August 31st - September 2nd**):
   - Before pushing our code to the **Galadriel** and **Morph** test environments, we need to clean up the existing codebase and finalize the interface contracts.
   - We will create a shared library that will be utilized by Tetiana's and CoolMan's contracts, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

2. **Unit Testing** (**September 3rd - September 4th**):
   - Once the code cleanup and shared library integration are complete, we will conduct thorough **unit testing** to ensure the stability and reliability of our smart contracts.
   - After successful testing, we will be ready to deploy our code to the test environments.

## :date: Upcoming Milestones Part 2

3. **:dart: *PRD1* Deadline** (**September 4th**):
   - We are aiming to meet the **:dart: *PRD1* deadline** by **September 4th**.
   - If time permits, we will explore the possibility of incorporating additional features, such as **Glitch Prophet** in our code and **XMTP messaging** for the waiting room (**:rocket: *PRD2***).
   - However, even if we cannot include these features in the MVP, we will ensure they are represented in our **UI/UX designs**.

4. **:projector: Video Demo and Final Preparations** (**September 7th**):
   - By **September 7th**, we aim to have a polished **video demo** showcasing our project's functionality and unique features.
   - This will require all components to be fully integrated and tested by **September 6th**, allowing us time to prepare the demo and make any final adjustments.

## :white_check_mark: Action Items

1. **Tetiana and CoolMan**:
   - Please review the **code cleanup** and **shared library integration plan** and provide any feedback or concerns you may have.
   - Be prepared to assist with the **unit testing** process once the code is ready.

2. **@harshalbhangale and @fakename3976**:
   - During our meeting on **September 1st**, please provide a clear update on the progress of the **UI/UX** and **Web3Auth** components.
   - If there are any blockers or challenges, let's discuss them openly and find solutions together.
   - Ensure that the **UI/UX designs** incorporate the additional features (**Glitch Prophet** and **XMTP messaging**) even if they are not implemented in the MVP.
