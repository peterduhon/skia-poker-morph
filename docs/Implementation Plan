# üÉè Skia Poker Technical Implementation Plan

## üìã Overview
This document outlines the technical implementation plan for the Skia Poker project, focusing on the steps required to clean up the codebase, integrate a shared library, conduct unit testing, and deploy to the Galadriel and Morph test environments. The plan also addresses the potential inclusion of additional features and the timeline for completing the MVP.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Cleanup and Shared Library Integration
1. **Objectives**:
   - Refactor and optimize the existing codebase to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
   - Create a shared library that encapsulates common functionality and interfaces used by Tetiana's and CoolMan's contracts.
   - Ensure the shared library is properly integrated into the respective contracts.

2. **Steps**:
   - Review the existing codebase and identify areas that require cleanup, such as redundant code, inefficient patterns, or inconsistent naming conventions.
   - Define the structure and components of the shared library, including any necessary interface contracts.
   - Implement the shared library, ensuring it adheres to best practices and is thoroughly documented.
   - Refactor Tetiana's and CoolMan's contracts to utilize the shared library, replacing any duplicated code or functionality.
   - Conduct code reviews and address any feedback or concerns raised by the team.

3. **Timeline**:
   - Commence code cleanup and shared library integration on **August 31st**.
   - Complete the implementation and integration by **September 2nd**.

## üîç Unit Testing and Testnet Deployment
1. **Objectives**:
   - Conduct comprehensive unit testing to validate the functionality, security, and reliability of the smart contracts.
   - Deploy the tested and verified contracts to the Galadriel and Morph test environments.

2. **Steps**:
   - Develop a suite of unit tests that cover various scenarios, edge cases, and potential vulnerabilities.
   - Ensure the unit tests are automated and can be easily executed as part of the development workflow.
   - Run the unit tests against the smart contracts and address any failures or issues identified.
   - Prepare the deployment scripts and configurations for the Galadriel and Morph test environments.
   - Deploy the contracts to the test environments and verify their functionality and interoperability.

3. **Timeline**:
   - Begin unit testing and testnet deployment preparations on **September 3rd**.
   - Complete the testing and deployment process by **September 5th**.

## üöÄ Additional Features and MVP Completion
1. **Objectives**:
   - Assess the feasibility of incorporating additional features, such as **Glitch Prophet** and **XMTP messaging**, into the MVP.
   - Ensure the UI/UX designs incorporate these features, even if they are not fully implemented in the MVP.
   - Complete all necessary components and integrations to meet the **PRD1 deadline**.

2. **Steps**:
   - Evaluate the complexity and effort required to implement **Glitch Prophet** and **XMTP messaging**.
   - If feasible within the given timeline, start the implementation process and integrate these features into the MVP.
   - Collaborate with the UI/UX team to ensure the designs reflect these additional features, providing a cohesive user experience.
   - Prioritize the completion of core MVP functionalities and address any critical issues or bugs.

3. **Timeline**:
   - Assess the feasibility of additional features by **September 4th**.
   - If proceeding with implementation, complete the integration by **September 6th**.
   - Ensure all MVP components are finalized and tested by **September 6th**.

## üé• Video Demo and Final Preparations
1. **Objectives**:
   - Create a polished **video demo** showcasing the features and functionality of the Skia Poker MVP.
   - Ensure the project is in a presentable state for the hackathon submission.

2. **Steps**:
   - Plan and script the video demo, highlighting the key aspects of the project.
   - Record and edit the video demo, ensuring high quality and clear explanations.
   - Conduct final testing and bug fixes, if necessary, to ensure a stable and reliable MVP.
   - Prepare the necessary documentation, including project descriptions, installation instructions, and user guides.

3. **Timeline**:
   - Finalize the MVP and conduct final testing by **September 6th**.
   - Record and edit the video demo on **September 7th**.
   - Submit the project and associated materials by the hackathon deadline.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
This technical implementation plan provides a structured approach to completing the remaining tasks and deliverables for the **Skia Poker** project. By following the outlined steps and timeline, the team can ensure a smooth and successful completion of the MVP, while also considering the potential inclusion of additional features.

Open communication, collaboration, and proactive problem-solving will be key to overcoming any challenges.
